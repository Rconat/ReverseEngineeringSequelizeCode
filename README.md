## Explanation of Code

Client Side Code



Server Side Code



Public Interation

In order for the public to interact with this code, they are first taken to the Sign Up Page. Here the user can enter in an email address as well as a password. Upon clicking the "SIGN UP" button the user has now created an account with the application. If the user has already created an account with the application, there is a button at the bottom of the Sign Up page which will take them to a Login Page instead. The Login Page opperates almost identically to the Sign Up with the only difference being that the user must have already signed up for an account with the application. Upon completing either the Sign Up form or the Login Form, the user is taken to the members page. This page welcomes the user by name and will become the home page for the user while implemented by the application.


## Usage 

This starter code can be implemented by a number of other applications and websites. Users can access the front pages to sign up for and login to a webpage or application. The code provides a great way to authenticate the user using a password saved to a server associated with the given user.

## Credits

This assignment was done under Trilogy Education Services through the Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp. The starter code for this assignment was provided by Trilogy Education Services.
